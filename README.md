To run a project using Docker, please follow these steps:

    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing your project's Dockerfile.


    Run the following command to build the Docker image and start the project:

    bash

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up

    This command uses the docker-compose.yml file to define the services and configurations for your project, and the docker-compose.override.yml file allows you to override specific settings as needed.

    Docker will start building the image and launch the project's containers. You will see the logs and output in the terminal as the containers start up.

    Once the containers are up and running, you can access your project through the specified ports or URLs, depending on your project's configuration.
